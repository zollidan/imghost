# ImgHost - Encrypted File Hosting Service

A **Vibcode** project for testing different AI agents and their coding capabilities.
This also description is generated by a neural network

## 🤖 AI Agents Tested

This project has been developed and enhanced by various AI agents to evaluate their coding performance:

- **OpenAI Codex** - Initial development and core functionality
- **Warp with Claude 4 Sonnet** - Advanced features and optimizations
- **Other AI agents** - Various improvements and testing

## 📋 Project Overview

ImgHost is a secure file hosting service that encrypts files before storing them in MinIO object storage. The application provides a web interface for uploading files and retrieving them using encryption keys.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - Military-grade encryption for all uploaded files
- **Random Key Generation** - Each file gets a unique encryption key
- **Automatic Deletion** - Files are automatically deleted after 15 minutes
- **Direct MinIO Upload** - Files are encrypted and uploaded directly to MinIO without local storage

## 🚀 Features

- Web-based file upload interface
- Real-time file encryption using AES-256-GCM
- MinIO object storage integration
- Automatic file expiration (15 minutes)
- Download decrypted files using encryption key
- No local file storage - direct stream processing

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Web Framework**: Chi router
- **Storage**: MinIO object storage
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with static assets

## 📦 Dependencies

```go
github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
github.com/minio/minio-go/v7
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure the application using environment variables:

```bash
MINIO_ENDPOINT=localhost:9000
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin123
MINIO_USE_SSL=false
MINIO_BUCKET=imghost-files
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Setup MinIO server** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
     -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin" \
     -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin123" \
     minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

├── static/              # Static assets (CSS, JS)
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Upload**: User uploads a file through the web interface
2. **Encrypt**: File is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a random key
3. **Store**: Encrypted file is uploaded directly to MinIO object storage
4. **Access**: User receives encryption key and nonce to decrypt the file
5. **Download**: User can download and decrypt the file using the key
6. **Expire**: File is automatically deleted after 15 minutes

## 🎯 AI Agent Testing Results

This project serves as a benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents:

- **Code Quality**: How well agents write clean, maintainable code
- **Security Implementation**: Proper encryption and security practices
- **Architecture Decisions**: Optimal design patterns and structure
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user experience
- **Performance**: Efficient file processing and memory usage
